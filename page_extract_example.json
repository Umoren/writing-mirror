  "content": "Business-to-business (B2B) data is information about other businesses, including company identification, funding and financial data, organization and management changes, product information, and other business-relevant data. It\u2019s used to enhance marketing and sales strategies. It\u2019s essential for businesses because understanding how to collect, manage, and use this data improves decision-making and aids marketing, growth, and sales teams in implementing effective strategies.\nThis guide will expose you to various types of B2B data, key use cases, and methods to gather this data (web scraping and datasets). It will also emphasize how your business can use this data to fuel their growth strategies.\nTypes of B2B Data\nB2B data is categorized into two groups: internal data, generated within a business (e.g. transaction, operation, and customer interaction data**),** and external data, data sourced from third-party sources or public information about other companies. In this guide, we focus on the external data. Let\u2019s explore various types of this data:\n\u2022 Firmographics: This is high-level data about companies such as the name, size, funding, headcount, hiring activities,  location, industry, and revenue. Companies use it to identify potential clients that fit specific industries, and market research.\n\u2022 Technographics: This data provides insights into the technologies other companies use, including the technology stacks of their employees. It\u2019s used for competitive analysis and sales targeting by tech-related companies.\n\u2022 People and Contact Data: You can also think of it as demographic data. It\u2019s essentially data about people. Data such as name, phone contact, email, work history, location, skills and more. Sales and marketing teams use this data for lead generation and building contact lists.\n\u2022 Intent data: This data signals when a company is interested in particular products based on web activity, engagement, or digital behaviors. It\u2019s a step up from chronographic data (information relating to events and changes in companies) because it\u2019s more targeted and easier to act on for marketing teams.\nHow to Collect B2B Data\nNow that you understand the importance of B2B data, let\u2019s explore how to collect it. The two primary methods for gathering external B2B data are web scraping and pre-collected datasets. Each approach has its strengths and limitations, we\u2019ll examine them in detail in the following sections.\nWeb Scraping\nWeb scraping lets you use automated tools to grab public information from public websites. Scraping data from publicly available websites is one of the most efficient ways to gather real-time B2B information, such as competitor updates, job postings, and customer feedback.  While web scraping is often seen as a gray area, It is legal as long as you comply with the CCPA and GDPR, do not collect data behind a login wall or that is not publicly available, and avoid personally identifiable information, you are fine.\nTo get started with web scraping, you\u2019ll need the right tools. Python provides a rich library ecosystem and the perfect language for this with libraries like requests for sending HTTP requests, beautifulsoup for parsing HTML and XML, and selenium for automating interactions with web browsers. While we won\u2019t cover the technical details of building a scraper here, you can follow this tutorial from Bright Data.\nMoreover, most companies work to prevent data scraping by implementing measures like IP bans, geo-restrictions, rate limits, and CAPTCHA challenges. For instance, in 2023, X (formerly Twitter) banned any kind of scraping or crawling without \u201cprior written consent.\u201d  In this case, a basic web scraper tool won\u2019t suffice, you need a web scraper tool that provides sophisticated web scraping APIs, tools, and proxy servers. A proxy server acts as an intermediary between your computer and the target webpages. It\u2019s like an invisibility cloak that allows the web scraper to bypass rate-limiting systems, location restrictions, and more. Bright Data provides a proxy-checking tool that tests and verifies the functionality and quality of proxies in a list, assessing factors like risk, geolocation, and type.\nWeb scraping is just one method of data collection; next, we\u2019ll explore the alternative\u2014pre-collected datasets.\nDatasets\nWeb scraping for b2b data requires a significant effort in setting up data infrastructure, investing in software development teams, and maintenance. Businesses that don\u2019t have the resources for this make use of predefined b2b datasets. Datasets are collections of data, often in tabular form such as a CSV or Excel file, focused on a specific topic or analysis.  Purchasing a dataset can be faster and more cost-effective, especially for businesses needing to prototype quickly or lacking the technical expertise to manage in-house data collection.\nHowever, low-quality datasets can be costly. Gartner (a tech research and consulting firm) estimates that poor data quality costs organizations an average of $15 million per year. Also, a global data quality report in 2015 reports that organizations believe that 27% of their revenue is wasted due to inaccurate and incomplete customer or prospect data. To avoid this, it\u2019s essential to choose reliable providers with a track record of quality. We recommend Bright Data Datasets. Bright Data ensures that each dataset undergoes rigorous quality assurance processes to ensure accuracy, reliability, and relevance. Additionally, they continuously update and refresh the datasets to reflect the latest information, ensuring that users always have access to the most current data.\nNow you know how to collect B2B data, let\u2019s explore the differences between building a custom web scraping tool and purchasing prebuilt datasets.\nWeb Scraping vs Pre-built Datasets\nIn the last section, we established that when it comes to collecting B2B data, businesses can either build their own web scraping infrastructure or rely on pre-built datasets. Each approach has its pros and cons, which should be weighed based on your business\u2019s resources, timeline, and data needs.\nCollecting B2B Data Yourself\nBuilding in-house web scraping infrastructure gives you full control of your data collection process. You have complete ownership.\nPros\n\u2022 You can tweak the scraping process to capture exactly the data you need, from specific sources, and at your preferred frequency.\n\u2022 As your business grows and evolve, you have direct control over your scraping setup which allows you to adjust according to business needs.\n\u2022 Long-term cost savings:  While setup costs are high, in-house infrastructure becomes more cost-effective over time, especially for businesses with ongoing data needs.\nCons\n\u2022 Building web scraping infrastructure requires significant time, technical expertise, and financial investment due to hiring specialized developers, setting up proxies, and ensuring compliance with legal guidelines.\n\u2022 Websites are constantly changing their structures and anti-scraping measures, so you'll need to regularly update your scraper to ensure it continues to function properly.\nOutsourcing B2B Data with Pre-Built Datasets\nPurchasing pre-built datasets offers a fast solution for companies needing reliable data without the overhead of building infrastructure.\nPros\n\u2022 Providers like Bright Data offers pre-processed, ready-to-use datasets, allowing you to start data-driven initiatives without delay. Also, you get access to a diverse and extensive range of B2B data that might be difficult, if not impossible, to gather independently. For instance, the Linkedin, Crunchbase, Indeed datasets, and more.\n\u2022 There\u2019s no need to worry about updating or maintaining a scraping setup. The provider handles all infrastructure, data collection, and updates.\n\u2022 Cost Efficiencies: Using pre-built datasets can save time and expenses, particularly for short-term or initial data needs.\nCons\n\u2022 The accuracy and freshness of the data depend entirely on the provider\u2019s quality standards and update schedules.\n\u2022 You\u2019re limited to the data provided by the third-party source, which might not always align perfectly with your specific needs.\nNow that you\u2019ve decided on a solution for collecting data, let\u2019s explore how to leverage B2B data effectively.\nHow to Leverage B2B Data\nThe next step after gathering B2B data is to strategically use it to drive business growth. In this section, we\u2019ll outline ways companies leverage B2B data to maximize impact.\nLead Generation and ICP Targeting\nB2B data is invaluable for refining lead generation and targeting Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs). Sales experts use it to enhance strategies, boost lead generation, and increase conversion rates. For example, a new web app hosting company can leverage technographic data to identify potential customers currently using complementary technologies that would benefit from their software solutions.\nCompetitive Analysis\nIf your company operates in the talent acquisition or human resources industry, analyzing review data from sources like Glassdoor will reveal employee sentiment and highlight potential red flags in competing companies. B2B data enables businesses to monitor data points such as competitors' technology stacks, locations, employee count, and product purchases. This helps anticipate competitors' moves and identify potential areas for growth or disruption.\nAccount-Based Marketing\nAccount Based Marketing (ABM) is a B2B marketing approach that focuses on specific accounts and their contacts.  With demographic data on organizational structure, contact information, and decision-makers within targeted companies, sales and marketing teams can craft personalized strategies that resonate with the key targets, consequently, increasing the likelihood of engagement and conversion.\nRisk and Market Analysis\nB2B data provides insight into potential risks and challenges, such as regulatory changes, economic shifts, or technological disruptions. Data points like company acquisitions, expansions, funding rounds, and changes in top management will signal potential shifts in the ecosystem. Businesses use this information to make informed decisions about investments, partnerships, and market entry strategies.\nThese are just some common applications of B2B data. To see how companies successfully use B2B data, explore customer stories from Bright Data for inspiration.\nConclusion\nIn this guide, you\u2019ve learned how B2B data is an indispensable asset for optimizing sales and marketing strategies.
